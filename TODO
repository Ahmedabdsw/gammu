- returned location for AT engine is wrong:
$ echo 'aa' | ./gammu/gammu savesms TEXT 123465
Saving SMS 1/1
Saved in folder "", location -99999, SIM
- add man page for gammu-smsd-mysql,... should contain DB structure and FILES information (currently preset in sample config)
- failing tests on windows
- move crap like following to gammu config to avoid so heavy usage of gsmstate.h header
#ifndef GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#  define GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#endif
- gammu-config and cdialog as a dialog alternative
