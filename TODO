This file is probably not usable for anybody except me ;-).

- move crap like following to gammu config to avoid so heavy usage of gsmstate.h header
#ifndef GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#  define GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#endif

- make gammu core interruptible by some flag. this is especially needed when connect takes ages
