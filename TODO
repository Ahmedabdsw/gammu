This file is probably not usable for anybody except me ;-).

- move crap like following to gammu config to avoid so heavy usage of gsmstate.h header
#ifndef GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#  define GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#endif

- drop multiple configurations handling in libGammu, it should provide just API to read some section from Gammurc and possible fall-back logic should be in application

- when SMSD fails to send message
    - SQL backend should store this state
    - the code needs review
