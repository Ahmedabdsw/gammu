This file is probably not usable for anybody except me ;-).

- move crap like following to gammu config to avoid so heavy usage of gsmstate.h header
#ifndef GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#  define GSM_USED_IRDAOBEX
#endif

- make gammu core interruptible by some flag. this is especially needed when connect takes ages

- drop multiple configurations handling in libGammu, it should provide just API to read some section from Gammurc and possible fallback logic should be in application

- add inject support for files backed and add tests for injecting and monitoring status

- add support for listing inbox messages in SMSD (to allow interface which will list them)
    - filtering flags: timestamp, processed
    - add support for setting processed flag via API

- add support for acquiring number of messages in sending queue

- add retries to DBI, for example MySQL server can go away, database can be locked...
