Gammu All Mobile Management Utilities
=====================================

[Installation]

1. Using autoconf (old, usually working method):

./configure
make
make install

To enable shared library, use "make shared" instead of "make".

2. Using cMake <http://www.cmake.org>:

For now, only out of source build is supported, so you have to create
separate directory for build.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

To enable shared library, use "cmake .. -DENABLE_SHARED=ON" instead of
"cmake ..".

You can configure build parameters either by command line (as shown
above), or using TUI - ccmake.
