python-gammu installation
=========================


UNIX systems - installation from sources
----------------------------------------

* Gammu library *

First you need Gammu. Either only built as static library or installed
with header files. To do it from source you can follow instructions in
Gammu sources. Shortened version follows here:

1. Download recent Gammu sources from <http://www.gammu.org/>.
2. Unpack it:
    > tar xfj gammu-*.tar.bz2
3. Configure (you might want to tweak configure parameters):
    > cd gammu-*
    > ./configure --prefix=/usr 
   Optionally you can make it shared library with --enable-shared t
4. Build:
    > make
5. Install:
    > sdo make install

* Pkg-config *

For finding gammu libraries, pkg-config is used, so please install it
also.

* Building python-gammu *

Then you can build and install python-gammu. It uses standard distutils,
so it contains from two simple steps:

> python setup.py build
> sudo python setup.py install


Custom installation place
-------------------------

You can override values acquired from pkg-config by passing parameters
to build target. This is useful when you don't have gammu installed, you
can pass path common directory in gammu sources as path to includes and
library:

python setup.py build \
    --gammu-libs=path_to_gammu_library \
    --gammu-incs=path_to_gammu_includes

Alternatively you can point setup.py to location where you built gammu:

python setup.py build \
    --gammu-build=path_to_gammu_build_directory

See "python setup.py build --help" for more options.

When running install later, you will probably need to add --skip-deps in
this case.


Windows systems
---------------

Current known working way to make static gammu library and then use it.
Files for static gammu build are placed in win32/STATIC/ directory in
gammu sources.

When you have the library, you need to point build system to right
location. As pkg-config is not well supported on Windows, you have to
specify paths manually in parameters (see above section).

Now you can launch build of python-gammu module.

Alternatively there are be prebuilt modules on python-gammu web site.
