python-gammu installation
=========================

It uses standard distutils, so:
python setup.py build
su
python setup.py install

You need Gammu installed as shared and you need pkg-config.

If you want to build with another Gammu than is accessible using pkg-config,
you may use:

GAMMU_LIB=path_to_gammu_library \
GAMMU_INC=path_to_gammu_includes \
python setup.py build running build
