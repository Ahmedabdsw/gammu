python-gammu installation
=========================


UNIX systems
------------

First you need Gammu installed as shared library and with header files. You
can use either packages for your favourite distribution or do it by hand
(replace XXX by current gammu version):

> tar xfj gammu-XXX.tar.bz2
> cd gammu-XXX
> ./configure --prefix=/usr
> make share
> su
# make installshared

For finding gammu libraries, pkg-config is used, so please install it also.

Then you can build and install python-gammu. It uses standard distutils, so:

> python setup.py build
> su
# python setup.py install

You can override values acquired from pkg-config by environment variables
GAMMU_LIB and GAMMU_INC:

GAMMU_LIB=path_to_gammu_library \
GAMMU_INC=path_to_gammu_includes \
python setup.py build



Windows systems
---------------

Current known working way to make static gammu library and then use it.
Files for static gammu build are placed in win32/STATIC/ directory in
gammu sources.

When you have the library, you need to point build system to right
location. As pkg-config is not well supported on Windows, you have to
specify paths manually in environment. Just set GAMMU_LIB to directory,
where static library you built before is placed and GAMMU_INC to
directory with sources (common subdirectory from gammu source tarball).

Now you can layunch build of python-gammu module.

Alternatively there will be prebuilt modules on python-gammu web site.
