For everyone who trys to decode the 7110 FBUS protocol a tip:
If in the Windows-Registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\moosy.development\TBE7110 
the String Data is replaced with a Binary with the name Data the program shows a 
error message at the begin but it also enables a option debug. This option 
displays a second window showing the trace of the FBUS. So it should be easier 
to decode the protocol. So it is possible to see the communiction while loading 
the phone numbers,  adresses,... and also syncronizing the calendar. 
 
I know it is a little bit unfair, don't tell me that.
 
I hope this is useful for someone
