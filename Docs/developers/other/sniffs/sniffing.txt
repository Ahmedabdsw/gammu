All this software was created from observating other programs - what they
send to/from phone. There two methods to dump transmission:

1.hardware

  You have to connect RxD (or TxD) and GND pin from the COM port, you use with
  phone, to the second COM port. Then you run soft, which will show, what is
  received by second port (now in win32 with enabled debug it can be
  "gnokii --sniff port")
  
  TIP: if you want to sniff MBUS, connect RxD (everything, what goes from
  TxD is repeated on RxD)
  
2.software

  You run emulator of OS, where program work. Then using emulator functions
  see, what is send (emulator is between phone and program, isn't it ?).
  
When you have transmission, try to find some identical sequences. If you will
have them, try to find each frame format...
