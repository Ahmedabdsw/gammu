To irda sniffs use irda_intercept.tgz
(http://www.dev-thomynet.de/nokworld/noktrace/index.html or tools directory
- unpacked source is there) from Thomas Schneider

how to use it:
you MUST stop irda support  ('rcirda stop' fur SUSE)
to free the infrared tty port.
just type irda_intercept and you should see
irda packages of port /dv/ttyS1 (hardcoded in source).
The tool writes also to file 'out.trc'.
Use this file to decode: 'gnokii --decodefile out.trc'
(mygnokii have to be compiled with debug)
