Hi ,
gtk for windows can be donloaded from www.gtk.org. On the left there's a
link to GTK+ on win32 (on the bottom of the page).

To compile xGnokii, using VC ide, you have to create a new win32 CONSOLE
application (NOT a win32 application) and then add the libraries.
TO COMPILE you need those libraries
gdk-1.3.lib
gtk-1.3.lib
glib-1.3.lib

        bye
        Daniele
