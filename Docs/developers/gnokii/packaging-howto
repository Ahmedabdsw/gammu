
 Common information:
	
	For more install/compilation information see the INSTALL file.
	
	(!) Makefiles support make install prefix=<your_directory> 
	    for package building. You can use it example in for .spec:
		
		./configure --prefix=/usr
		make install prefix=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr

	    (You not need create any dirs - all make make install.)

	    For a installation procedure is used 'make install' or
	    'make install prefix=', and all outputs from this routine must be 
	    correct. Please, not make any correction in your package specific 
	    build system (example use 'cp' in package routines - .spec - 
	    it is job for Makefiles). Write more different routines for 
	    instalation is good way to hell...
	
	 'make install' not install documentation, because for this use 
	 any distribution itself routines. If you want install docs via
	 Makefile you must type 'make install-docs'  

 Debian:
	
	1/ Add new lines to Debian/changelog and set corect verion in this
           file.

	2/ Check files: rules, menu, docs

	3/ Well, because gnokii's debian directory is in subdirectory 
	   'packaging' and it is total non-standard for Debian package 
	   building system, you must firstly type in top directory:

	   # ln -s packaging/Debian debian	
  
	3/ In source type:

	   # debian/rules binary
	   # debian/rules clean

	4/ Delete symlink

           # rm debian
