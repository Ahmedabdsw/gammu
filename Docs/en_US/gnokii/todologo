NAME
	todologo.perl - Create operator logo that contains 3 lines of text

SYNOPSIS
	todologo.perl <text of line> - <text of line 2> - <text of line 3>

DESCRIPTION
	The `todologo.perl' program is used to create three lines of text 
	that fits to the standard Nokia operator logo space (i.e. 72x14 
	pixel space). This is achieved by using a proportional tiny font 
	which most elements have size of 3x4 pixels (some are thinner). 

	The name comes from an original intention that this program is
	used to create todo entries to one's mobile phone screen so that
	those are always visible and thus in user's memory. But the tool
	can just be used to print arbitrary text to the space provided
	by an operator logo.

	The hand-crafted font currently supports the following characters:
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz and 0123456789

OUTPUT
	The standard `.nol' formatted operator logo is printed to 
	standard output. The header information of that output is taken 
	from `gnokii.nol' that is distributed with Gnokii -- so you most
	probably need to give your operator code when uploading it to your
	mobile phone. Use `Gnokii' or `Xlogos' to do the uploading.

EXAMPLES
	First example writes some todo entries to todo.nol:

	  todologo.perl pick up kids - call wife - order chinese >todo.nol

	This last example writes some wisdom to the stdout:

	  todologo.perl Never underestimate - the power of the dork - \
			side of the force
