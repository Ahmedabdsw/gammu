<p>Nokia phone can support three protocols of transmission over cable:

<p>
<ul>
<li>M2BUS (called often simply MBUS) - 9600,N,...</li>
<li>FBUS - 115200</li>
<li>AT mode - 19600</li>
</ul>

<p>You cable can support each of them...and phone must be compatible with it
(for example, CAN'T use DLR-3 with phone, which show "headset connected"
after connecting it)...

<p>Simple M2BUS (only) cable:
<p><img src=cable1.gif>
<p>Note:
<br>
<ul>
<li>74HC04 must be in HC version</li>
<li>Dioda Zenera 3,2 V it required for phones different than 21xx, 3110</li>
</ul>

<p>FBUS cable:
<p><img src=cable2.gif>

<p>Switch for M2BUS/FBUS for cable above:
<p><img src=switch.gif>

<p>Cable for AT mode is unavailable here, because it needs programmed chip
and I don't know, what programm should be inside...

<p>To make FBUS/MBUS cable you have to connect:
<p>
<ul>
<li>FBUS - GND, TX and RX</li>
<li>M2BUS - MBUS and GND</li>
</ul>

<p>
<ul>
<li>DAU-3 (or DAU-3H) - cable for Nokia series 2100. 
Sell with Nokia Cellularware (it isn't produced now).
</li>

<li>
DAU-4S - cable for Nokia 3110 and all models in series 8100 (8110, 8110i, 8148 and 8148i).
Sell with Nokia Cellularware (it isn't produced now).
</li>

<li>
DAU-4F - uniwersal (FBUS/M2BUS) cable without switch,
for Nokia 3110 and all models in series 8100 (8110, 8110i, 8148 and 8148i).
Sell with Nokia Cellular Data Suite 1.0 (it isn't produced now).
</li>

<li>
DAU-9P - uniwersal (FBUS/M2BUS) cable without switch, for Nokia 51x0/61x0.
Sell with Nokia Cellular Data Suite 1.2 - 3.0a.
</li>

<li>
DLR-1 - cable sell with Nokia 9000 Communicator. It can be used
to exchange date between phone and computer and installing software into phone.
It's M2BUS cable.
</li>

<li>
DLR-2 - cable sell with Nokia 9110 Communicator. It can be used
to exchange date between phone and computer and installing software into phone.
It's M2BUS cable, but can't be used with programs working with this protocol (needs
some small changes - after them will not work original Communicator programms).

<li>
DLR-3 and DLR-3P - cables for Nokia 7110/6210. Supports AT mode and FBUS.
FIXME: MBUS too ?
</li>
</ul>

<p>See post from gnokii maillist:

<p>The dlr-3 CAN'T work with the older phones. this is because the 
converter in the cable is powered by the phone. this is done by the 
phone by raising the !mic-gnd! pin to vcc. if the cable doesn't 
repond on the mbus after 1 second, the power is dropped. a older 
phone doesn't do this, so the converter is unpowered.

<p>To decide if a phone needs a dau-9 (the old one, powered by pc) or 
the new one (dlr-3) simply connect a dlr-3 to the phone. if the 
phone says "headset connected" it isn't capable of using a dlr-3 
and you have to change to a dau-9.
