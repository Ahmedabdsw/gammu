#                           DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS

# PORT
# -----------
# Set port to the physical serial port used to connect to your phone
# In Linux /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc.
# In Win32 COM1:, COM2:, etc.

# MODEL
# -----------
# Set model to the model number of your phone
# In this moment:
#
# for Nokia:
# 6185
# 3210|3310|5110|5130|5190|6110|6130|6150|6190|8210|8850
# 6210|7110
#
# for AT phones:
# at
#
# Please notice, that in some phones (like 7110)
# it will be (now or in the future) provided double support - AT commands
# or protocol specific for phone model (fbus, mbus, etc.)
#
# You can also use model "auto" and gnokii will try to find your
# phone model on "port" port. This option is during development and
# can not work excellent...Let'say - with all new supported Nokia phone
# connected over FBUS/DLR3 cable you will not have any problem.
# With other can be and it will have to be set manually.

# INITLENGTH
# -----------
# Initlength controls the number of characters sent to the
# phone during initialisation.  You can either set it to
# the word "default" or a positive integer.
#
# You can try setting this value if you want to connect
# to the phone quicker.  If you've never noticed the
# connection to be slow, it is suggested that you 
# leave this alone.  Read the initialisation code in fbus-xxxx
# to understand what this changes if you're curious.

# CONNECTION
# -----------
# The type of the connection. Can be:
#
# @"mbus". Models:
# 6210|6250|7110
# 6185
# 3210|3310|3330|5110|5130|5190|6110|6130|6150|6190|8210|8850
#
# "infrared" (for direct infrared connection - in 8210/8250 use two players
# snake menu to enter into it). Models:
# 6110|6130|6150|8210|8850
#
# "tekram210" (for direct infrared connection using Tekram 210
# - in 8210/8250 use two players snake menu to enter into it). Now in Unix only.
# Models:
# 6110|6130|6150|8210|8850
#
# "irda" (infrared over Irda sockets - now in Unix only)
# Models:
# 6210|6250|7110
#
# @"fbus". Models:
# 6210|6250|7110
# 3210|3310|3330|5110|5130|5190|6110|6130|6150|6190|8210|8850
#
# @"dlr3". Models:
# 6210|6250|7110
#
# @"at". Models:
# at

# BINDIR
# -----------
# Set bindir to point to the location of the various gnokii binaries.
# In particular ensure that mgnokiidev is in this location, with
# permissions 4754, owned by root, group gnokii.  Ensure you
# are in the gnokii group and that the group exists...
# Setting not important for win32

# SYNCHRONIZETIME
# -----------
# set it to "yes", if want to have set time from computer to phone
# each time, when use gnokii, xgnokii or gnokiid
# Function works, of course, only then, when setting time is implemented
# for your phone
# With some phones (if it's enabled or if you generally changed date/time
# during session with phone), after soft reset (without asking for PIN)
# phone can lost date/time settings and ask for them or disable clock
# on the phone screen. Seen for 6150 and 6210

# LOGFILE
# -----------
# When there are problems with mygnokii, you have two ways
# to help in resolving them:
# 1.compiling mygnokii with debug and sending dump to marcin-wiacek@topnet.pl
# 2.using this option. Mygnokii will be slower, because during work will
#   create file with name set here with short
#   info about transmission. Send it to marcin-wiacek@topnet.pl
# Method 1 is better. When not possible (for example, when have only
# compiled binary version), use 2.

# USE_LOCKING
# -----------
# Under Unix set this to 'yes' if you want gnokii to set and check the
# lock file in /var/lock directory. It avoids potential conflicts with
# other serial port software (eg. minicom). If you have wrong permissions
# for the directory, a warning will be generated. If you don't want a lockfile,
# set it to 'no'.


#                                 EXAMPLES

#1.Nokia 5110, fbus cable on "/dev/ttyS1" port with gnokii/xgnokii
#  Gnokiid uses "default" config
#[global]
#port=/dev/ttyS1
#model=5110
#connection=fbus

#2.Nokia 5110 working with NCDS (win32) on "com1:" port with gnokii
#  Gnokiid uses "default" config
#[global]
#port=com1:
#model=ATGSM

#3.Nokia 7110 and dlr-3 cable. It's connected to "/dev/ttyS1" port.
#  First we want to run gnokiiid and connect to phone with fbus.
#  Then run gnokii/xgnokii and work over gnokiid (for testing gnokii
#  AT emulator and AT module - in normal work gnokiid is not required, because
#  7110 with dlr3 has own AT commands interpreter).
#[global]
#port=/dev/gnokii
#model=ATGSM
#[gnokiid]
#port=/dev/ttyS1
#model=7110
#connection=dlr3

#4.Nokia 7110 and dau9p cable. It's connected to "/dev/ttyS1" port.
#  Gnokii/xgnokii work using fbus protocol (can't use AT commands
#  from 7110, when use dau9p)
#  Gnokiid uses "default" config
#[global]
#port=/dev/ttyS1
#model=7110
#connection=fbus

#5.Nokia 7110 and dlr-3 cable. We want to connect with it using fbus
#  Gnokiid from gnokii is not required (with dlr3 can use AT commands built in
#  into phone, not our small ;-) AT interpreter)
#[global]
#port=/dev/ttyS1
#model=7110
#connection=dlr3

# [receivesms]
# ------------
# This section is for the --receivesms command.
# This command will open a connection to the phone and keep it open polling it
# at regular intervals for received SMSes. Each received SMS is stored
# in a file in a directory.
#
# All paths must be terminated by the '/' character.
#
# PATH
# -----------
# Directory for storing received SMSes
# The format stored is the same as the format of the SMS as retrieved by the
# --getsms command.
#
# OUTBOXPATH
# -----------
# Directory from which files to be sent as SMSes are retrieved.
# If defined the directory specified will be searched for files to send as SMSes.
# Each file is similar to the --sendsms command:
#   line 1: --sendsms <parameters as for --sendsms >
#   line 2-n: text to be sent
#
# LOGPATH
# -----------
# Directory for the gnokiiSMS.log file
#
# DELAY
# -----------
# Number of seconds between polling for received SMSes and SMSes to send
