More information
================

You can find more information on <http://wammu.eu/gammu/>.

There is also Gammu manual available in docs/manual. You can build HTML
version of it using make manual-html which is viewable online at
<http://wammu.eu/docs/manual/>.


Configuration
=============

Gammu requires configuration to be able to properly talk to your phone.
You can create own by starting from example in docs/config/gammurc,
where parameters are described, or use utils/gammu-config script
(installed to bin), which can help you to generate valid configuration.

Alternatively you might want to try GUI for Gammu called Wammu (see
<http://wammu.eu/>), which can automatically generate configuration for
you.

The configuration file should be placed in ~/.gammurc or /etc/gammurc on
Unixes. On Windows you can place gammurc in Application Data folder in
your profile or in same directory as is binary being executed from.

For hints about configuring your phone, you can check Gammu Phone
Database <http://wammu.eu/phones/> to see what user users
experienced.
