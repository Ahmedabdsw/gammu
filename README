1.What is this ?
----------------
This is my own version of gnokii...

It was created from CVS gnokii 0.3.3_pre8-gold and contains many other changes.
I decided to make it, since gnokii project seemed to be frozen (from 07.2000 ?)
and my changes were ignored.

In this moment CVS gnokii is developed again. It went into different
direction (doesn't use threads and probably will work better on multi CPU
systems), but many functions still are worse than in mygnokii

Now there is small cooperation of these two projects(some new CVS source is in
mygnokii and some things from mygnokii are in CVS), but they're more and more
different and I don't think, that they will join again
(well, I implemented almost all Smart Messaging and other functions
Everything works rather correct and only bugs need to be removed. Because of
it I'm not sure, if it will have sence for me to write it again for CVS gnokii-
especially, that I don't like organisation there and IMHO every change needs
there tons of explanations and emails)

So, if you think, that mygnokii works better for you, use it and please help
in improving or testing. I will try to answer on each your email (of course,
I can't promise :-( ).

If you like more CVS gnokii, use gnokii. That's all.

2.Where to send your updates to gnokii ?
----------------------------------------
If you made something - patch, script, etc., which could be useful for gnokii
users, please send it to the Marcin-Wiacek@Topnet.PL. THX

3.How to apply patches ?
------------------------
Make "patch < patchfile", where patchfile is name of file with patch.

4.How to create patches ?
-------------------------
1.copy source with gnokii, you start from, into "gnokii" dir
2.copy source with gnokii, you want to modify, into "work" dir
3.make changes in "work"
4.go into subdirectory with "gnokii" and "work"
5.make "diff -urx CVS gnokii work > patchfile"
6.send "patchfile" to me ;-)

5.TODO
------
6210:
  * support for voice tags in phonebook
  * NBS (with preview) uploading for caller/op logos
  * probably speed dials need some improvements

Other:
  * support for 5210, 5510, 6310, 6510, 8310 (sniffs required)
  * support for irda sockets in win32
  * EMS
  * support for more AT phones and commands
  * compatibility with gnomecal
  * end xgnokii

6.BUGS and INCOMPATIBILITIES
----------------------------
Other:
  * gnome viewers have sometimes problems with displaying bmp files
    written by gnokii. This is NOT mygnokii fault.
  * phone sometimes doesn't want to speak over mbus (when previous
    transmission was cut - some ACK were not sent/received) in command line
    gnokii in Unix/Linux. Must restart phone and then and works...
  * sometimes, when read alphanumeric numbers, name is 1 char too long
  * when save some SMS to phone (8 bit with UDH), after forwarding them
    from phone menu they're changed. 100% firmware bug (6210, probably
    each Nokia phone with SMS memory)

-----
If know some other, please let me know to marcin-wiacek@topnet.pl.
Please include version of mygnokii, description of bug and debug info from it
(the best, if you can compile it with debug and send me it; if have only
 executables, you can use "logfile" option in gnokiirc to make it).
