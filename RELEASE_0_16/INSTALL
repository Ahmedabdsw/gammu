python-gammu installation
=========================


UNIX systems - installation from sources
----------------------------------------

First you need Gammu installed as shared library and with header files.

1. Download recent Gammu sources from <http://www.gammu.org/>.
2. Unpack it:
    > tar xfj gammu-XXX.tar.bz2
3. Configure (you might want to tweak configure parameters):
    > cd gammu-XXX
    > ./configure --prefix=/usr
4. Build as shared library:
    > make share
    > su
5. Install as shared library:
    # make installshared

For finding gammu libraries, pkg-config is used, so please install it also.

Then you can build and install python-gammu. It uses standard distutils, so:

> python setup.py build
> su
# python setup.py install


Custom installation place
-------------------------

You can override values acquired from pkg-config by passing parameters to
build_ext target. This is useful when you don't have gammu installed,
you can pass path common directory in gammu sources as path to includes
and library:

python setup.py build_ext \
    --gammu-libs=path_to_gammu_library \
    --gammu-incs=path_to_gammu_includes

Alternatively you can point setup.py to location where you built gammu:

python setup.py build_ext \
    --gammu-build=path_to_gammu_build_directory

See `python setup.py build_ext --help` for more options.


Windows systems
---------------

Current known working way to make static gammu library and then use it.
Files for static gammu build are placed in win32/STATIC/ directory in
gammu sources.

When you have the library, you need to point build system to right
location. As pkg-config is not well supported on Windows, you have to
specify paths manually in parameters (see above section).

Now you can launch build of python-gammu module.

Alternatively there are be prebuilt modules on python-gammu web site.
