Few last versions (the highest) will be described more detailed, older less.
In brackets names of people, who told about error/problem or helped in fixing.
----------------------
20021020 - 0.61

* new functionality:
  * getting voice records from such DCT4 like 6310 or 6310i (new
    --nokiagetvoicerecord) (EXPERIMENTAL)
    NOTE: created WAV files requires GSM 6.10 codec. In the future
          codec will be probably added to Gammu.
  * full compatiblity with EMS IMelody 1.2 (earlier          (Christian Becker)
    was 1.0), saving ime/imy files
  * docs contains examples for editing backup text files       (Kolesar Andras)
    in TextPad, backup files are now more user friendly
    for editing - for example, when delete one pbk entry,
    all after it are interpreted
  * added possibility of using standard Unix configure
    script for automatic configuring all options    
    NOTE: this is first version of Autoconf build system.
          Probably many things inside will be changed to better.
	  All ideas very welcome.
  * dialvoice for DCT4
    NOTE: it should be possible to make data calls using FBUS with DCT4,
          probably also with 62xx/7110
	  
* fixes and improvements:
  * atblue works OK                                           (Marcel Holtmann)
  * some MyGnokii2 names changed to Gammu, display status can   (Krishna Dagli)
    be incoming frame for n6110.c
  * compatibility fixes for 9210 and AT mode
  * many small fixes for win32 dll

  * changes in Unix serial driver - earlier wasn't compatible      (few people)
    with all Linux kernel versions and some distributions

CHANGED PROJECT NAME FROM MYGNOKII2 TO GAMMU
(GNU All Mobile Management Utilities).

(Too) many people wrote to me, that MyGnokii2 name shows, that project
is connected with Gnokii and supports Nokia phones only. Currently it's
not truth - there were tested Alcatel, Nokia, Siemens and WaveCom devices
and I hope to test more :-). Also Gammu doesn't have too much shared with
Gnokii source and developing methods

PLEASE NOTE, THAT ALSO gnokiirc CONFIG FILE IS NOW NAMED gammurc !!!!!

If you installed older version into your OS, please uninstall it first
(for example using "make uninstall").
