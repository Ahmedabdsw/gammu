--------------------
20031125 - 0.90.0
* new functionality:
  * * added lots of API documentation                            (Michal Cihar)
    * support for GetProductCode in Alcatel
  * * support for AT^MI for Siemens                                     (Walek)
    * --siemensnetmonitor renamed to --Siemenssatnetmon and extended 
      with decoding in Mensure result info in 128, 256, 512 and 1024 format
      ranges
  * ADDED PART OF BLACKSPHERE PROJECT (THE MAIN FOR TASK IS UNDERSTANDING (W.J)
    DCT3 PHONES FIRMWARE AND PREPARING OPEN SOURCE REPLACEMENT FOR IT).
    CURRENTLY YOU NEED FILE WITH DEBUG TRACES (LIKE nhm5_587.txt).
    gammu --nokiadebug nhm5_587.txt v20-25,v18-19 will enable displaying
    traces for types 20-25 and 18-19 (you can give more ranges of course).
    When use types 18-19, out.xml file is additionaly created. It can be parsed
    later with OpenGPA.
    For more about these things see http://zope.achterklap.nl:8080/nokia/
  * new parameter "gammucoding" in gammurc. In Linux value (SMS WebMaster, ...)
    "utf8" will force using UTF8 console support, in win32
    can give codepage ("852", "1250", etc.) and specified
    codepage will be used. Without it default values will
    be used (default console coding). I haven't tested utf8 yet
  * structure with sms folders contains info, whether folder is on SIM or
    not and whether it's Inbox or not
  * SMS structure contains info about memory, where SMS is saved
  * 2 new GSM networks                                           (Timo Metsala)

* fixes and improvements:
  * * use soname in library                                      (Michal Cihar)
    * makefile modified, so it now links only when needed
    * makecleantree, makerpm and makedeb renamed to cleantree, rpm and deb
    * configure uses cat <<EOT instead of several echos
    * fixed version parsing in configure and debian/rules
    * fixed pkgconfig files (contained bad path to includes)
    * rename PBK_Name to PBK_Text_Name (all other text entries have such name)
    * GSM_SecurityCode.Code has now len GSM_SECURITY_CODE_LEN and not
      some hardcoded number
    * Alcatel:
      * fixed reading of alarms without date
      * call ATGEN_Terminate from ALCATEL_Terminate
      * alcabus now works okay over IrDA, the phone didn't like
        fragmented packets
    * AT models are separated to slow (M20) and fast (other). Fast work
      fast now.
    * fixed displaying of PictureID in gammu
  * rpm changes:                                     (Michal Cihar, Soos Peter)
    * should work on both Redhat and SUSE with correct Group,
      path names etc.
    * build requires bluez (can be disabled)
    * added ldconfig to post/postun
    * use a bit more rpm macros
    * spec file moved to root of sources, this allows direct build of rpm
      from tarball: `rpmbuild -ta tarball' 
  * fix for n7110.c and 0xf8 sms folder during saving sms
  * fix for incorrect folder name for --addnokiafile
  * fix in decoding BASE64 and SE T68i calendar encoding                (Walek)
  * removed stupid bug, which didn't allow to restore VCF and VCS files

NOTE: Changed license of project. Before saying something see copying file for
      info, why and how it's done.

      I'm searching hard for any Siemens x35 or x45 (x means any) now and
      maybe Nokia 3200 (6220 will be probably very expensive).

      Maybe somebody will be interesting in giving (for some time ?) any cheap
      DCT4 phone (maybe 6310i, maybe 3510i) to author of BlackSphere project.
      He is a student, lives in The Netherlands and could start reversing DCT4
      phones with it

      Please expect big progress in AT commands in 0.91 version
      
20031109 - 0.89.0.0
* new functionality:
  * encoder for VCARDS can save info about default number
  * --save/sendsms VCARD10|VCARD21 by default uses "normal" VCARD (Michael Kim)
    formats (text of vcard is included into sms without any headers).
    It's used in SE phones. When add new switch -nokia, there is used
    Nokia format (Nokia UDH). In earlier versions there was used Nokia
    format by default

    * updated info about supported Alcatel models
    * in gammu.c:
      * printmsg("\n") replaced with printf("\n"). There is no need
        to translate \n anyway
      * no need to translate xml so s/printmsg/printf/
      * unified message for increasing some constant to "   Increase %s\n"
      * open debug file just once, even when there are more config sections
      * much simplified content of while (Parameters[z].Function != NULL)
        loop
      * a bit more helpful error messages for options
  * internals of win32 dll thread rewritten (faster, better, can handle
    more error situations, can have null callbacks, etc.)

    * in gammu/gammu.c:
      * new --getallmemory
      * new --listtodocategory
      * added -sent to sms (this was default, but it should be there)
      * new --getfilesystemstatus
      * --searchphone searches for at devices on IrDA on linux
      * complete rewrite of help system - now help always mathes what program 
        really handles, help splitted to smaller pages, help is wrapped to
        real terminal size, gammu --help doesn't overwrite logfile
      * can specify user config from gammurc
  * quick hack for making RPMs alive

* fixes and improvements:
  * * changed order of monitor mode to speed up things for       (Michal Cihar)
      Alcatel
    * missing \n in AddNew
    * fixed compilation of gammu under some conditions:
      name colision        #define _GNU_SOURCE         #include <stdio.h>
      defines dprintf functions and it colides with same function in gammu,
      renamed to dbgprintf
    * missing void in some functions definitions
    * fixed passing CFLAGS to configure script
    * default speed in serial port for unix same as on other places (19200)
    * in _OnePhoneModel use Feature type instead of int
    * fixed ALCATEL_GetNext functions for case when location was deleted
    * in gammu/gammu.c:
      * fixed --searchmemory and --listmemorycategory - comparsion didn't work,
        didn't show location of found entry
      * --listmemorycategory, --searchmemory and --getmemory now correctly
        terminate connection on SIGINT

NOTE: because of many internal changes (in this and 0.87.4 release) please
      test all things very deeply and inform about problems.

NOTES: Adding new functionality to Nokia Series 40 phone modules will be
       probably suspended for some time. I will make fixes and fill missed
       things, but generally can't add really new things because of hardware
       issues (no available phone with more functions). I added to readme.txt
       info about all missed things and info about things, which probably never
       will be implemented (they require SDK or more info from Nokia).

       I'm thinking about changing Gammu license and probably (if there won't
       be any other possibility) I will have to give LGPL for project sponsors,
       who will request it (for other there will be GNU GPL like now).

       If You have comments, please mail me or send email to mailing list.

          no phones with more options now)
    * long ringtones can be send in downloadable profiles (--send/savesms
      PROFILE) and as normal long ringtones (--send/savesms RINGTONE xxx -long)

NOTE: during about two weeks I tried to force company, where I bought
      my graphic card, to replace it (it was defected and still with warranty)
      For now I had to buy new card :-(((((( I didn't have access to almost
      ready 0,80 version (and didn't want to make some actions with moving
      HDD to another PC, etc., etc.) and I decided to work on next branch
      on friend's PC. Now You see joined results from all this work.

      Because of this some things are dropped to 0,81 (I don't want to make
      more delays). Also all reported during last month things will be made
      there (I didn't have access to emails and will process them now)

20030628 - 0,79,0,0

    * there are two principle rpm versions (3.x and 4.x) in use (SuSE, RedHat)
      and they differs in (among others) binary, which is used for building;
      so new check is done in configure (= configure.in) and proper binary
      is then put into variable in Makefile.cfg
    * newly build rpms are moved from building directory (tree) to parent
      of current directory (to be found more easily)
    * added removing of autoconf cache directory into "make clean"
  * VERY EXPERIMENTAL:
    * when use vcs extension during backup, there is created VCALENDAR file
      with Calendar and ToDo. It's first step for making exchanging data
      with various PIM managers
    * started work on OBEX ("irdaobex"/"blueobex" connection            (Intra)
      with "obex" model). Tested with Nokia 5100, 6310i and SonyEricsson T300:
      * can upload files to phone default inbox with --addfile (folderID = 0)
      * can get file with phone features info with --getfiles (folderID = 0)

      unsigned removed
    * -autolen in send/savesms fixed
  * better allocating memory in MBUS2 driver                     (John Fremlin)

      2. full compatibility with various PIM managers
      3. Symbian support (after getting some hardware ?)
      4. DKU-5 support (after getting some hardware ?)
      5. other ;-)

           templates)
  * getting GPRS access points (new --getgprspoint)
  * new --savefile can extract VCARD and VCALENDAR from backup   (Bharat Varma)
    files. Later such files can be send to phone.

             irftp d:\ala.vcf
    (irftp is part of Windows XP) will create VCARD file and send it to phone
  * full support for wbmp files (reading, creating, correctly adding
    to DCT4 filesystem)
  * support for GPRS and DATA bearer over SMS is now complete
    (it includes MMS settings over SMS)

    NOTE: NOKIA PHONES SEEMS TO IGNORE GPRS ONLINE SETTING. YOU HAVE TO
          SET IT MANUALLY

  * during uploading midlets Gammu displays info about uploaded midlet
  * Gammu GUI 0.0.34                                            (Luca Cassioli)
  * support for enabling/disabling LED, enabling/disabling light
    and enabling/disabling vibra supported by Imelody and EMS. Just use
    zD/zd/zL/zl/zV/zv commands in RTTL file.

* fixes and improvements:
  * many functions in service/* now gets pointer to structure    (Michal Cihar)
    instead whole structure (this should reduce memory usage)
  * by default new DCT4 use new calendar frames again
  * smaller buffer during adding files to DCT4                   (Jorge Bardok)
  * improved getting values from JAD files                       (Lim Swee Tat)

      with specified name already exist. If yes, there is error returned
  * added getting and setting activated bearer for WAP settings
  * ID for N6800                                                   (Tom Nelson)
  * full support for MMS settings in DCT4

* fixes and improvements:
  * file system in DCT4 & different folder             (Lim Swee Tat and other)

  * improved infrared error codes
  * improved allocation memory in AT protocol module             (Michal Cihar)

20030518 - 0.75
* new functionality:
  * setting files in DCT4 (adding to Gallery, Tones, MMS folders
    and other), adding folders, deleting files

    Note1: if You saved incorrectly file and phone reboots after enabling,
           use --getfilesystem to get file ID and use --deletefile BEFORE
           entering PIN to delete this file
    Note2: support for file formats depends on phone firmware. For example
           3510 supports GIF in 16 colors and 96x65 size. Some other can
           be not shown in this phone in menu, although stay in memory
           (use --getfilesystem to find such files & --deletefiles to delete).
           New phones happily generally show incorrect files in menus and allow
           to delete them from phone menu.
    Note3: tested on 3510, 3510i and 6310i. With other will need sniffs
           (because of different bytes in header or folder names) for making
           support

    * added Email2 phonebook field
    * added getting of category name to --getmemory  
  * 6210/7110 identify in some situations improved               (Bharat Varma)

NOTE: for 5100, 6100, 6610, 7210, 7250 I need testing FM & ToDo (and probably
      sniffs). Please additionaly check calendar support and report all other

    experimental and THERE CAN BE SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME SEQUENCES. PLEASE
    REPORT IT. In the future there will be added support for formating
    text, ODI, UPI and variable images (I will try to code it although I
    don't have supporting it phone)

20030126 - 0.67
* new functionality:
  * added --clearall (cleaning pbk, calendar, wap bookmarks
    and todo from phone)
  * added --addnew (adding new calendar, wap bookmarks      (Tomasz Motylewski)
    and todo from backup file without deleting existing)
  * added support for Siemens MIDI ringtones                            (Walek)

  * removed incorrect reference to man dir (it made problems during
    installing)
  * win32 dll is more stable in many situations
  * added info about used phone module to logs
  * rewritten getting SMS folder names for DCT4 (compatible with 3510
    3.37)
  * setting WAP things and getting profiles disabled for 3510 4.24 now.
    Phone restarts very often after using it. Reason unknown.
  * maximal length of SMS name is 40 chars
  * rewritten calendar structures to more portable
  * made very deep look into calendar in N62xx/71xx and DCT4 phones.
    There are two ways to access it. Gammu can support them both. However
    they make sometimes problems:

    * with method 1 can't get/set some calendar notes in 3510 3.37
    * with method 2 can't get some notes from 6210 (probably firmware here
      uses some a little different coding)

    I decided, that for setting will be used always method 2, for getting
    method 1 (for 62xx/71xx) or method 2 (for DCT4).

    Please note, that both method 1 and method 2 have problems in DCT4 with
    such notes like (tested on 6310i 5.10 and 3510 3.37):

    * Birthday with alarm. When set in phone, it always set it (time) to
      23:59.
    * Reminders with alarm. Can't get/set alarm time
    * notes other than Birthday with alarm. Can't get/set alarm type (silent
      or with tone)
    * notes with different start date/time than end date/time. Don't have
      info in frames about end date/time

    and this is not Gammu fault !

* new functionality:
  * some (started) functions for Siemens like support for VCalendar     (Walek)
    and MIDI ringtones
  * new name for 204-12 GSM operator                           (Bertrik Sikken)

        a very long time to react on first AT

      error message
    * dprintf flushes written texts
    * added Debian packaging

* fixes and improvements:

    OK in all version now ? It should...
  * SMS Daemon should be bug free now                    (me + Joergen Thomsen)
  * extensions to GSM Default Alphabet are not Nokia specific,     (Timo Teras)
    but from GSM 03.38
  * EMS functions should be bug free now                         (Ondrej Rybin)
  * removed few possibilites of memory problems from win32 dll
  * * removed possible memory problems in many places            (Michal Cihar)
    * removed some segfaults possibilities from debug system
    * configuration scripts
      * hide %c warning in newer gcc (at least for 3.0 and 3.2, but
        surely not for 2.95)
      * use "$@" instead of $* in configure, it works correctly for
        args with spaces

NOTE: Summary for 2002
      -----------------
      Current version works without bigger problems with Nokia DCT3/DCT4,
      AT (with various Siemens extensions) and Alcatel phones. User can
      exchange various formats of logos and ringtones (send them in EMS or
      Nokia format over SMS), WAP settings and bookmarks (send over SMS in
      Nokia format), etc. There is ready command line version with manual
      and SMS daemon.

  * fix for EMS ringtones                                    (Christian Becker)

20021112 - 0.62

NOTE: These days were very hard for me:
      1. FKN.PL (also my homepage/Gammu homepage/Gammu list) was down
         during few days. Reason: hardware faults. Sorry for it
      2. my phone was in service
      3. I had to reinstall my Linux
      4. I had to reinstall majority of my win32 environment
      5. Because of action of Netia company TopNet.PL domain sometimes work,
         sometimes not, sometimes work partialy (www works, email not). Many
         lost nerves for me and work connected with registering own domain
         mwiacek.com and changing everywhere topnet.pl addresses to mwiacek.com
      6. Family problems :-(

      Because of it there was so long timeout after 0.61 and some things are
      still not implemented. Sorry for it.

20021020 - 0.61
* new functionality:
  * getting voice records from such DCT4 like 6310 or 6310i (new
    --nokiagetvoicerecord) (EXPERIMENTAL)
    NOTE: created WAV files requires GSM 6.10 codec. In the future
          codec will be probably added to Gammu.
  * full compatiblity with EMS IMelody 1.2 (earlier          (Christian Becker)
    was 1.0), saving ime/imy files
  * docs contains examples for editing backup text files       (Kolesar Andras)
    in TextPad, backup files are now more user friendly
    for editing - for example, when delete one pbk entry,
    all after it are interpreted
  * added possibility of using standard Unix configure
    script for automatic configuring all options    

    NOTE: this is first version of Autoconf build system.
          Probably many things inside will be changed to better.
          All ideas very welcome.

  * dialvoice for DCT4

    NOTE: it should be possible to make data calls using FBUS with DCT4,
          probably also with 62xx/7110

CHANGED PROJECT NAME FROM MYGNOKII2 TO GAMMU
(GNU All Mobile Management Utilities).

(Too) many people wrote to me, that MyGnokii2 name shows, that project
is connected with Gnokii and supports Nokia phones only. Currently it's
not truth - there were tested Alcatel, Nokia, Siemens and WaveCom devices
and I hope to test more :-). Also Gammu doesn't have too much shared with
Gnokii source and developing methods

PLEASE NOTE, THAT ALSO gnokiirc CONFIG FILE IS NOW NAMED gammurc !!!!!

If you installed older version into your OS, please uninstall it first
(for example using "make uninstall").
