      Nokia format over SMS), WAP settings and bookmarks (send over SMS in
      Nokia format), etc. There is ready command line version with manual
      and SMS daemon.

          Note: I have in my library specs for many models (example: Morotola,
                Sagen, Siemens xx45) and it's only required to code few 
                functions into current source to have support for them...

NOTE: These days were very hard for me:

      1. FKN.PL (also my homepage/Gammu homepage/Gammu list) was down
         during few days. Reason: hardware faults. Sorry for it
      2. my phone was in service
      3. I had to reinstall my Linux
      4. I had to reinstall majority of my win32 environment
      5. Because of action of Netia company TopNet.PL domain sometimes work,
         sometimes not, sometimes work partialy (www works, email not). Many
         lost nerves for me and work connected with registering own domain
         mwiacek.com and changing everywhere topnet.pl addresses to mwiacek.com
      6. Family problems :-(

      Because of it there was so long timeout after 0.61 and some things are
      still not implemented. Sorry for it.

* new functionality:
  * getting voice records from such DCT4 like 6310 or 6310i (new
    --nokiagetvoicerecord) (EXPERIMENTAL)
    NOTE: created WAV files requires GSM 6.10 codec. In the future
          codec will be probably added to Gammu.

    was 1.0), saving ime/imy files
  * docs contains examples for editing backup text files       (Kolesar Andras)
    in TextPad, backup files are now more user friendly
    for editing - for example, when delete one pbk entry,
    all after it are interpreted
  * added possibility of using standard Unix configure
    script for automatic configuring all options    
    NOTE: this is first version of Autoconf build system.
          Probably many things inside will be changed to better.
	  All ideas very welcome.

CHANGED PROJECT NAME FROM MYGNOKII2 TO GAMMU
(GNU All Mobile Management Utilities).

(Too) many people wrote to me, that MyGnokii2 name shows, that project
is connected with Gnokii and supports Nokia phones only. Currently it's
not truth - there were tested Alcatel, Nokia, Siemens and WaveCom devices
and I hope to test more :-). Also Gammu doesn't have too much shared with
Gnokii source and developing methods

PLEASE NOTE, THAT ALSO gnokiirc CONFIG FILE IS NOW NAMED gammurc !!!!!

If you installed older version into your OS, please uninstall it first
