Cross compiling python-gammu for Windows
========================================

What you need:

1. Built Gammu library (tested only with static one).

2. Python for Windows. You can install it in Wine:
    /usr/bin/msiexec /i /tmp/python-2.5.msi

3. If Gammu was built with gettext, you will need it (otherwise you have
   to modify Makefile).

Building steps:

1. Edit Makefile to contain paths that fit your environment.

2. Run make and pray.

3. You will get Core.pyd, which should work on Windows (but it will
   probably need libintl3.dll and libiconv2.dll libraries).

To create installer on Windows:

1. Unpack python-gammu sources on Windows

2. Copy Core.pyd and libintl3.dll and libiconv2.dll libraries to
   build/lib.win32-2.5/gammu/ directory inside sources.

3. Run:
    python.exe setup.py build_ext -s build -s bdist_wininst

Now you shoud have installator in dist directory.
