       -inputunicode      - input text is in Unicode.
                            TIP: You can create Unicode file using WordPad
                                 in Win32 (during saving select
                                 "Unicode Text Document" format).
                                 In Unix can use for example YUdit.
       -replacemessages ID - ID can be 1..7. When you will use option and
                             send more single SMS to one recipient
                             with the same ID, each another SMS will
                             replace each previous with the same ID
       -replacefile file   - when you want, you can make file in such format:
                             src_unicode_char1,dest_unicode_char1,
                             src_unicode_char2,dest_unicode_char2
                             (everything in one line).
                             After reading text for SMS from stdin there will
                             be made translation and each src char will be
                             converted to dest char. In docs there is example
                             file (replace.txt), which will change all
                             "a" chars to "1"

       TIP: when use ~ char in sms text and -unicode option (Unicode coding
            required), text of sms after ~ char will blink in some phones
            (like N33xx)

       can be used few times.

       Example: gammu --savesms EMS -text "Greetings" -defsound 1
                -text "from Gammu" -tone10 axelf.txt -animation 2 file1.bmp
                file2.bmp

       will create EMS sequence with text "Greetings" and default sound 1
       and text "from Gammu" and ringtone axelf.txt and 2 frame animation read
       from (1'st frame) file1.bmp and (2'nd frame) file2.bmp

   gammu --nokiagetoperatorname
       6110.c phones have place for name for one GSM network (of course,
       with flashing it's possible to change all names, but Gammu is not
       flasher ;-)). You can get this name using this option.

   gammu --nokiasetoperatorname networkcode name

   gammu --nokianetmonitor test
       Takes output or set netmonitor for Nokia DCT3 phones.
       TIP: For more info about this option, please visit
            http://www.mwiacek.com and read netmonitor manual.
       TIP: test 243 enables all tests (after using command
            "gammu --nokianetmonitor 243" in some phones like 6210 or 9210
            have to reboot them to see netmonitor menu)

   gammu --nokianetmonitor36
       Reset counters from netmonitor test 36 in Nokia DCT3 phones.
       TIP: For more info about this option, please visit
            http://www.mwiacek.com and read netmonitor manual.

   gammu --nokiasetvibralevel level
       Set vibra power to "level" (given in percent)

   gammu --nokiagetvoicerecord location
       Get voice record from location and save to WAV file. File is
       coded using GSM 6.10 codec (available for example in win32). Name
       of file is like name of voice record in phone.

   gammu --nokiasecuritycode
       Get/reset to "12345" security code

   gammu --nokiatests
       Make tests for Nokia DCT3 phones
       NOTE: EEPROM test can show error, when your phone has EEPROM in flash
             (like in 82xx/7110/62xx/33xx). The same Clock test will show error
             when phone doesn't have internal battery for clock (like 3xxx)

       ...and for DCT4 (work in progress)

   gammu --nokiasetphonemenus
       Enable all (?) possible menus for DCT3 Nokia phones:

       1. ALS (Alternative Line Service) option menu
       2. vibra menu for 3210
       3. 3315 features in 3310 5.45 and higher
       4. two additional games (React and Logic) for 3210 5.31 and higher
       5. WellMate menu for 6150
       6. NetMonitor

       and for DCT4:

       1. ALS (Alternative Line Service) option menu
       2. Bluetooth, WAP bookmarks and settings menu,...(6310i)
       3. GPRS Always Online
       ...

   gammu --backup file
       Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone):

       * phonebook from SIM and phone memory
       * calendar notes
       * SMSC settings
       * operator logo
       * startup (static) logo or startup text
       * WAP bookmarks
       * WAP settings
       * caller logos and groups
       * user ringtones

       when use text backup files. List can be extended on request.

       TIP: if you will backup settings to Gammu text file, it will be
            possible to edit it. It's easy: many things in this file will
            be written double - once in Unicode, once in ASCII. When you will
            remove Unicode version, Gammu will use ASCII on --restore
            (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it according
            to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
            it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones
            - it isn't important, what locale is set in computer and no
            conversion Unicode -> ASCII and ASCII -> Unicode is done).
       TIP: you can use any editor with regular expressions function to edit
            backup text file. Example: TextPad 4.2.2 from
            http://www.textpad.com/ with regular expressions based on
            POSIX standard P1003.2 is OK for it. Few examples for it:

            * to remove info about voice tags:
              FROM: ^Entry\([0-9][0-9]\)VoiceTag = \(.*\)\n
              TO:
            * to change all numbers starting from +3620, +3630, +3660, +3670
              to +3620
              Find: Type = NumberGeneral\nEntry\([0-9][0-9]\)Text =
                    "\+36\(20\|30\|60\|70\)
              Repl: Type = NumberMobile\nEntry\1Text = "\+3620
            * to change phone numbers type to mobile for numbers starting from
              +3620, +3630,... and removing the corresponding TextUnicode
              line
              F: Type = NumberGeneral\nEntry\([0-9][0-9]\)Text =
                 "\+36\(20\|30\|60\|70\)\([^\"]*\)"\nEntry\([0-9][0-9]\)TextUnicode = \([^\n]*\)\n
              R: Type = NumberMobile\nEntry\1Text = "\+36\2\3"\n

   gammu --backupsms file

   gammu --restore file
       Restore settings written in file created using --backup option.
       All things backup'ed by --backup can be restored (when made backup to
       Gammu text file).

       In some phones restoring calendar notes will not show error, but won't
       be done, when phone doesn't have set clock inside.

   gammu --restoresms file

   gammu --addnew file

   gammu --clearall

   gammu --decodesniff MBUS2|IRDA file [phonemodel]
       Option available only, if Gammu was compiled with debug.
       Allows to decode sniffs. See /docs/develop/develop.txt for more details.

   gammu --decodebinarydump file [phonemodel]
       After using option "logfile" with name "binary" (see /readme.txt for
       info about this method of reporting bugs) created file can be decoded
       using this option. It's available only, if Gammu was compiled
       with debug.
