libGammu
========

The libGammu library exposes all Gammu functionality for various phones in
standard API. It can be used to do anything with your phone, however for
easier tasks you might prefer to use Python and :doc:`../python/index`.

.. warning::

   The C API documentation is still more complete in Doxygen format
   available on Gammu website. This still lacks some parts due to
   problems in Doxygen - Sphinx bridge.
