Creating patches
----------------

I will describe, how to make patch using diff. If you can't make it,
simply send me info about changes in plain text email or attached ASCII
file.

1. copy source with Gammu, you start from, into "gammu" dir
2. copy source with Gammu, you want to modify, into "work" dir
3. make changes in "work"
4. go into subdirectory with "gammu" and "work"
5. make "diff -urx CVS gammu work > patchfile"
6. send "patchfile" to me ;-)
