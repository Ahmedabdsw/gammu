I don't know anything about the 6310, but it should work as same as the
6210 over Bluetooth. For the moment gnokii only needs support for
AT*NOKIAFBUS to switch from a terminal connection to a FBUS connections.
If this is their you can easily use gnokii over the Bluetooth RFCOMM
protocol.

Regards

Marcel
