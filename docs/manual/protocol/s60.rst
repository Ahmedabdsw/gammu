Series60 Remote Protocol
========================

.. note:: 

    The original applet has been created for
    <http://series60-remote.sourceforge.net/>. Gammu currently uses slightly
    extended version which will be hopefully merged back.

Choosing right version
----------------------

Before using this connection type, you need to install the applet to the
phone. The applet can be found in ``contrib/s60`` directory and there are two
variants of the applets:

``series60-remote.sis``
    Not signed applet, which can be installed to the phone if it has enabled
    installation of unsigned applications.

    .. note::
       
        This applet also lacks some capabilities, so for example you will not
        be able to get network information.

``series60-remote-sign.sis``
    Applet ready for signing using `Open Signed Online`_. This will allow you
    to install applet to your phone only (it is bound to IMEI), but you don't
    need to allow installation of unsigned applications.

.. note:: 
   
   The best way of course would be to have properly signed applet. However
   access to signing tools costs 200 USD per year, what is something we can
   not afford right now.

Installation
------------

To run the applet you need to install `Python for S60`_ 2.0 to the phone. You
can either download it from their website, or just get mirrored installation
package from <http://dl.cihar.com/gammu/s60/Python_2.0.0.sis>. This file is
not distributed with Gammu due to licensing reasons.

.. note::

    On some phones, the Python for S60 2.0 will not start, in this case you
    need to install some additional support libraries coming with Python for S60 2.0 - 
    :file:`pips.sis`, :file:`ssl.sis` and :file:`stdioserver.sis`. You can get
    all of them at http://wammu.eu/s60/ as well.

Installing Python for S60 and Series60 remote applet can be done in several
ways:

Installation using Gammu
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Gammu can transmit the applet to your phone automatically. Just configure it
for use of S60 connection (see :ref:`connecting-s60` chapter bellow) and
invoke :option:`gammu install`:

.. code-block:: sh

   gammu install

It will automatically transmit the applet to the phone. On some phones the
installation will start automatically, on some you need to find received files
in the inbox and install them manually from there.

Downloading from phone
++++++++++++++++++++++

Downloading files from the phone and installing them directly. You can
download all required files from http://wammu.eu/s60/.

Connecting
----------

The Gammu configuration is simple, all you need to specify is correct
:config:option:`Connection`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [gammu]
    connection = blues60
    device = 5C:57:C8:XX:XX:XX # Address of the phone

Now you need to start the Series60 applet in the phone and Gammu should be
able to talk to it.
