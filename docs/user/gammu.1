.TP
.BI "backupsms" " file"

.TP
.BI "deleteallsms" " folder"
Delete all SMS from specified SMS folder.

.TP
.BI "deletesms" " folder start [stop]"
Delete SMS from phone. See description for \fB\-\-getsms\fR for info about
sms folders naming convention. Locations are numerated from 1.

.TP
.BI "displaysms" " ... (options like in sendsms)"

.TP
.BI "getallsms" " \-pbk"
Get all SMS from phone. In some phones you will have also SMS templates
and info about locations used to save Picture Images. With each sms you
will see location. If you want to get such sms from phone alone, use
\fBgammu \-\-getsms 0 location\fR

.TP
.BI "geteachsms" " \-pbk"
Similiary to \fB\-\-getallsms\fR. Difference is, that links all contacenated sms

.TP
.BI "getsms" " folder start [stop]"
Get SMS. Locations are numerated from 1.

When give folder 0, sms is given from "flat" memory (all sms from all
folders have unique numbers). It's sometimes emulated by Gammu.
You can use it with all phones.

When give folder 1, 2, etc. sms are taken from Inbox, Outbox, etc.
and each sms has unique number in his folder. Name of folders can
depend on your phone (the most often 1="Inbox", 2="Outbox", etc.).
This method is not supported by all phones (for example, not supported
by Nokia 3310, 5110, 6110). If work with your phone, use
\fB\-\-getsmsfolders\fR to get folders list.

.TP
.BI "getsmsc" " [start [stop]]"

be made translation and each src char will be converted to dest char. In docs
there is example file (\fIreplace.txt\fR), which will change all "a" chars to "1"

\fITIP:\fR when use ~ char in sms text and \fB\-unicode\fR option
(Unicode coding required), text of sms after ~ char will blink in some phones
(like N33xx)

\fIExample:\fR echo some_text | gammu \-\-savesms TEXT

file).

.TP
.BI "backup" " file [\-yes]"
Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone):

* phonebook from SIM and phone memory
.br
* calendar notes
.br
* SMSC settings
.br
* operator logo
.br
* startup (static) logo or startup text
.br
* WAP bookmarks
.br
* WAP settings
.br
* caller logos and groups
.br
* user ringtones

when use text backup files. List can be extended on request.

\fITIP:\fR if you will backup settings to Gammu text file, it will be possible to edit
it. It's easy: many things in this file will be written double \- once in Unicode,
once in ASCII. When you will remove Unicode version Gammu will use ASCII
on \fB\-\-restore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it
according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones \- it isn't important,
what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \->
Unicode is done).

\fITIP:\fR you can use any editor with regular expressions function to edit
backup text file. Example: TextPad 4.2.2 from http://www.textpad.com/
with regular expressions based on POSIX standard P1003.2 is OK for it.
Few examples for it:

.br
* to remove info about voice tags:
.br
FROM: ^Entry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)VoiceTag = \\(.*\\)\\n
.br
TO:
.br

* to change all numbers starting from +3620, +3630, +3660, +3670
to +3620
.br
Find: Type = NumberGeneral\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)Text = "\\+36\\(20\\|30\\|60\\|70\\)
.br
Repl: Type = NumberMobile\\nEntry\\1Text = "\\+3620
.br

* to change phone numbers type to mobile for numbers starting from
+3620, +3630,... and removing the corresponding TextUnicode line
.br
F: Type = NumberGeneral\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)Text = "\\+36\\([2367]0\\)\\([^\\"]*\\)"\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)TextUnicode = \\([^\\n]*\\)\\n

.TP
.BI "backup" " file [\-yes]"
Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone):

* phonebook from SIM and phone memory
.br
* calendar notes
.br
* SMSC settings
.br
* operator logo
.br
* startup (static) logo or startup text
.br
* WAP bookmarks
.br
* WAP settings
.br
* caller logos and groups
.br
* user ringtones

when use text backup files. List can be extended on request.

\fITIP:\fR if you will backup settings to Gammu text file, it will be possible to edit
it. It's easy: many things in this file will be written double \- once in Unicode,
once in ASCII. When you will remove Unicode version Gammu will use ASCII
on \fB\-\-restore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it
according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones \- it isn't important,
what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \->
Unicode is done).

\fITIP:\fR you can use any editor with regular expressions function to edit
backup text file. Example: TextPad 4.2.2 from http://www.textpad.com/
with regular expressions based on POSIX standard P1003.2 is OK for it.
Few examples for it:

.br
* to remove info about voice tags:
.br
FROM: ^Entry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)VoiceTag = \\(.*\\)\\n
.br
TO:
.br

* to change all numbers starting from +3620, +3630, +3660, +3670
