.SH NAME
gammu\-smsd \- SMS daemon for Gammu
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgammu\-smsd\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBgammu\-smsd\fP command.
.PP
\fBgammu\-smsd\fP is a program that periodically scans GSM modem for received
messages, stores them in defined storage and also sends messages enqueued in
this storage.
.PP
The daemon can reload configuration file after sending hangup signal
(SIGHUP) and properly terminates itself on SIGINT and SIGTERM.
.PP
Program accepts following options (please note that long options might be
not accepted on some platforms):
.TP 
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Shows help.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Shows version information and compiled in features.
.TP 
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-config\fP=\fIfile\fP
Configuration file to use, default is /etc/gammu\-smsdrc, on Windows there is
no default and configuration file path has to be always specified.

If you run SMSD as a system daemon (or service), it is recommended to use
absolute path to log file as startup directory might be different than you
expect.

See gammu\-smsdrc(5) for config file documentation.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pid\fP=\fIfile\fP
Lock file for storing pid, empty for no locking. Not supported on Windows.
.TP 
\fB\-U\fP, \fB\-\-user\fP=\fIuser\fP
Drop daemon privileges to chosed user after starting.
.TP 
\fB\-G\fP, \fB\-\-group\fP=\fIgroup\fP
Drop daemon privileges to chosen group after starting.
.TP 
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-daemon\fP
Daemonize program on startup. Not supported on Windows.
.TP 
\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-install\-service\fP
Installs SMSD as a Windows service.
.TP 
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-uninstall\-service\fP
Uninstalls SMSD as a Windows service.
.TP 
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-start\-service\fP
Starts SMSD Windows service.
.TP 
\fB\-k\fP, \fB\-\-stop\-service\fP
Stops SMSD Windows service.
.TP 
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-max\-failures\fP=\fIcount\fP
Terminate after defined number of failures. Use 0 to not terminate (this is
default).
.TP 
\fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-suicide\fP=\fIseconds\fP
Kills itself after number of seconds.
.TP 
\fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-run\-service\fP
Runs pogram as SMSD Windows service. This should not be used manually, but
only Windows Service manager should use this command.
.TP 
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-service\-name\fP=\fIname\fP
Defines name of a Windows service. Each service requires an unique name, so
if you want to run several SMSD instances, you have to name each service
differently. Default is "GammuSMSD".

.SH EXAMPLE

.SS "Linux/Unix Examples"

.TP 
Start SMSD as a daemon on Linux:

.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
gammu\-smsd \-\-config /etc/gammu\-smsdrc \-\-pid /var/run/gammu\-smsd.pid \-\-daemon
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP

.TP 
Start SMSD as a daemon on Linux with reduced privileges:

.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
gammu\-smsd \-\-config /etc/gammu\-smsdrc \-\-pid /var/run/gammu\-smsd.pid \-\-daemon \-\-user gammu \-\-group gammu
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP

.TP 
SMSD as a system wide daemon

To use SMSD as a daemon, you might want to use init script which is shipped
with Gammu in contrib/init directory. It is not installed by default, either
install it manually or check INSTALL file for instructions.

Under Windows 7 you might need to disable UAC (user account control) before
you will be able to install SMSD service.

.SS "Windows Service Examples"

.TP 
Install Gammu SMSD Windows service:

.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
gammu\-smsd.exe \-c c:\eGammu\esmsdrc \-i
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP

.TP 
Install two instances of SMSD Windows service:

.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
gammu\-smsd.exe \-c c:\eGammu\esmsdrc\-1 \-n Gammu\-first\-phone \-i

gammu\-smsd.exe \-c c:\eGammu\esmsdrc\-2 \-n Gammu\-second\-phone \-i
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP

.TP 
To uninstall a Windows service:

.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
gammu\-smsd.exe \-u
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP

.SS "Troubleshooting Windows Service"

If Gammu fails to start as a Windows service (you will usually get "Error
1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a
timely fashion"), first check your SMSD logs. If they do not contain any
useful hint, try starting SMSD manually with exactly same parameters as you
installed the service (without \-i).

.TP 
For example the command line can look like:

.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
gammu\-smsd.exe \-c smsdrc
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP

.PP
You now should be able to get errors from SMSD even if it fails to start as
a service.

.SH "KNOWN LIMITATIONS"

You can not use same phone by more programs in same time. However in case
you did not enable locking in [gammu] section, it might be able to start the
communication with phone from more programs. In this case neither of the
programs will probably work.

There is no way to detect that SMS message is reply to another by looking at
message headers. The only way to achieve this is to add some token to the
message and let the user include it in the message on reply.
