Please install gammu-1.17 or upper.
And then execute make in the shell, like,

shell#> make 

This will create "smscgi" executable file.
To make it work please edit the gammu config file
and add a config like,

cgi-bin = /your/script/path

Now run the server. When the user sends sms like,

==================
echo I am fine
==================

The server will find executable file named "echo" at
cgi-bin path. If "echo" does not exist then the it will
execute "error" script.


Enjoy !
