Subject: Patches and spaces

Hi Marcin

[...]

And second thing I'd like to do a little cleanup. I've set my editor to 
strip spaces at the end of lines, so you might noticed some conflicts 
while applying patches. Following one liner if executed in gammu tree 
will strip spaces at the end of lines in all source files.

find . -type f -name '*.[ch]' -exec sed -i 's@[[:space:]]*$@@' {} \;
