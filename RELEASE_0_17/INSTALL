python-gammu installation
=========================


UNIX systems - installation from sources
----------------------------------------

First you need Gammu installed as shared library and with header files.

1. Download recent Gammu sources from <http://www.gammu.org/>.
2. Unpack it:
    > tar xfj gammu-XXX.tar.bz2
3. Configure (you might want to tweak configure parameters):
    > cd gammu-XXX
    > ./configure --prefix=/usr
4. Build as shared library:
    > make share
    > su
5. Install as shared library:
    # make installshared

For finding gammu libraries, pkg-config is used, so please install it also.

Then you can build and install python-gammu. It uses standard distutils, so:

> python setup.py build
> su
# python setup.py install

You can override values acquired from pkg-config by environment variables
GAMMU_LIB and GAMMU_INC:

GAMMU_LIB=path_to_gammu_library \
GAMMU_INC=path_to_gammu_includes \
python setup.py build



Windows systems
---------------

Current known working way to make static gammu library and then use it.
Files for static gammu build are placed in win32/STATIC/ directory in
gammu sources.

When you have the library, you need to point build system to right
location. As pkg-config is not well supported on Windows, you have to
specify paths manually in environment. Just set GAMMU_LIB to directory,
where static library you built before is placed and GAMMU_INC to
directory with sources (common subdirectory from gammu source tarball).

Now you can launch build of python-gammu module.

Alternatively there will be prebuilt modules on python-gammu web site.
