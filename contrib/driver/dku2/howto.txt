Subject: dku2/6230 patch, howto

Marcin asked I post this tiny tarball -- inside you will find the dku2 
kernel 2.6 driver code (from Chris Kemp @ the gnokii project), slightly 
patched to include the Nokia 6230 product ID. You will find a patch from 
Marcin to gammu-1.00.04 to fix dku2 support. And lastly, a Makefile from 
me to build this kernel module in kernel 2.6.

1) build and install the kernel module -- this is for 2.6 *only*, it 
will not work on a 2.4 kernel. The Makefile uses the standard convention 
of /usr/src/linux-2.6 as the kernel source home; if you already have 
that, simply type "make; make install" and you're done.

NOTE: if you're on Fedora Core 3 and have no clue how to prepare your 
kernel source for building external modules, follow step #1 in my HowTo 
for the rt2x00 project on Sourceforge:

   http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2959689

2) [....removed point 2 - it was about Gammu patch, which is already included]

3) Compile gammu as normal (./configure; make)

4) Plug in your 6230, and look in /var/log/messages for the device that 
was registered as "FBUS". It should look like this:

   kernel: Nokia FBUS Port:
   kernel: Nokia DKU2 1-2:1.10: Nokia 7600/6230 DKU2 driver converter 
detected
   kernel: usb 1-2: Nokia 7600/6230 DKU2 driver converter now attached 
to ttyUSB0

NOTE: there are two drivers that fight for the AT side of your Nokia -- 
the stock "cdc_acm" driver and the "nokia_dku2" module. So, if cdc_acm 
got there first and created ttyACM0, then most likely your 6230 will be 
ttyUSB0. If the nokia_dku2 got there first, then most likely your AT 
will be ttyUSB0, and the FBUS port ttyUSB1. I've had it happen both ways.

5) make sure /dev/ttyUSB* is owned by the user running gammu! 
chown/chmod it as needed. On my FC3 machine I added the proper 
configurations to /etc/security/console.perms to chown it to the logged 
in user for me:

   Under this line: <raw1394>=/dev/raw1394
   Add this line:   <usbdev>=/dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*

   Under this line: <console>  0600 <raw1394>    0600 root
   Add this line:   <console>  0600 <usbdev>     0600 root

Log out and log back in and it will work properly for you forever.

6) Configure your .gammurc:

   [gammu]
   port = /dev/ttyUSB0
   connection = dku2

7) run gammu --identify! At this point is should be working.

I tested --identify, --getfilesystem, --nokiaaddfile, and --backup and 
they all appear to be working normally. The kernel module seems to be 
rather unstable (locked up my phone once, requiring a battery removal) 
so your mileage may vary. It's a first release, so you're kind of 
playing with fire a little bit. It does work enough to do a --backup and 
get all your data off the phone, which is a good first step. :)
