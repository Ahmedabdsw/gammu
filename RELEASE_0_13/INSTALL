python-gammu installation
=========================

First you need Gammu installed as shared library and with header files. You
can use either packages for your favourite distribution or do it by hand
(replace XXX by current gammu version):

> tar xfj gammu-XXX.tar.bz2
> cd gammu-XXX
> ./configure --prefix=/usr
> make share
> su
# make installshared

For finding gammu libraries, pkg-config is used, so please install it also.

Then you can build and install python-gammu. It uses standard distutils, so:

> python setup.py build
> su
# python setup.py install

You can override values acquired from pkg-config by environment variables
GAMMU_LIB and GAMMU_INC:

GAMMU_LIB=path_to_gammu_library \
GAMMU_INC=path_to_gammu_includes \
python setup.py build running build
