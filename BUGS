Gammu All Mobile Management Utilities
=====================================

This text lists known issues (mostly the design ones), which would be
really good to fix:

- Using of own unicode implementation instead of wchar_t.

- Hardcoded limits for almost all fields.

- Messing up with unsigned char in many places.

- Possibility from extend libGammu by applications is really bad
  designed.

- AT module should have common AT command generator.
